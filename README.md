# flatdata [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/heremaps/flatdata.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/heremaps/flatdata)

Flatdata is a library providing data structures for convenient creation, storage and access of packed memory-mappable structures with minimal overhead. Library consists of schema language, code generator for C++, Python and Go, and target language libraries.

## Why `flatdata`?

Flatdata helps creating efficient datasets:

* Zero overhead random access
* Support for bit and byte packing
* Structuring data using a schema definition
* Optimized for large read-only datasets
* Portable with support for multiple languages

Flatdata doesn't provide:

* Backwards compatible schema evolution
* Support for mutable datasets
* Portable floating point serialization

For more details read [why flatdata](docs/src/why-flatdata.rst).

## Building `flatdata`

The C++ part of the library depends on Boost. The schema generator and the Python part of the
library require Python 3.

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
make
make test  # optional
```

## Using `flatdata`

*Note: Until the release APIs are expected to be undergoing (potentially breaking) changes. Binary data layout is stable, though.*

Define a flatdata archive, let's say `locations.flatdata`:
```cpp
namespace loc {
    struct Point {
        x : u32 : 32;
        y : u32 : 32;
    }
    archive Locations {
        pois : vector< Point >;
    }
}
```

Generate a C++ header `locations.hpp` from it.
```shell
./generator/app.py --gen cpp --schema locations.flatdata --output-file locations.hpp
```

Serialize some data:
```cpp
// Compile with: c++ -std=c++11 writer.cpp -Iflatdata-cpp/include -Lbuild/flatdata-cpp -lflatdata -lboost_system -lboost_filesystem -o writer
#include "locations.hpp"
int main() {
  auto storage = flatdata::FileResourceStorage::create("locations.archive");  // create storage
  auto builder = loc::LocationsBuilder::open(std::move(storage));             // create builder
  auto pois = builder.start_pois();

  uint32_t x, y;
  while(std::cin >> x >> y) {
      loc::PointMutator poi = pois.grow();
      poi.x = x;
      poi.y = y;
  }
  pois.close();  // flush not yet written data to disk
}
```

And finally, read the serialized data:

```cpp
// Compile with: c++ -std=c++11 reader.cpp -Iflatdata-cpp/include -Lbuild/flatdata-cpp -lflatdata -lboost_system -lboost_filesystem -o reader
#include "locations.hpp"
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    auto storage = flatdata::FileResourceStorage::create("locations.archive");  // open storage
    auto archive = loc::Locations::open(std::move(storage));              // create archive
    for (loc::Point point : archive.pois()) {                             // iterate through pois
        std::cout << point.to_string() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Library Layout

Library is organized as follows:

   * `generator` includes sources of the flatdata code generator.
       * `generator/app.py` executable script. Use it to generate code in target language.
   * `flatdata-cpp` includes C++ library sources. Client application needs to include and
                      link against this library.
   * `flatdata-py` includes python library sources. Client application needs to have this
                     folder in PYTHON_PATH. 
   * `flatdata-go`  includes Go library sources. Client application needs to have `flatdata-go/flatdata`
                     folder in GOPATH.
   * `tools` contains tools to work with flatdata archives.
       * `tools/inspect_flatdata.py` provides interactive python interpreter loaded with a specified
           archive.

At the moment following languages are supported:

   * *C++*. Main development target and first-class citizen. Used extensively, tested excessively,
       normally receives features first. Use `cpp` generator.
   * *Python*. Used mostly for debugging and testing purposes, thus it is always a bit late.
       Use `py` generator.
   * *Dot*. Used to generate diagrams of the schema. Normally, it is up to date.
       Use `dot` generator.
   * *Go*. Beta implementation for reader. No guarantees of backward compatibility at the moment! Use `go` generator.
