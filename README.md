_Write once, read-many, minimal overhead binary structured file format._

Flatdata is a library providing data structures for convenient creation, storage and access of packed memory-mappable structures with minimal overhead.

With `flatdata`, the user defines a schema of the data format using a very simple schema language that supports plain structs, vectors and multivectors. The schema is then used to generate builders and readers for serialization and deserialization of the data to an archive of files on disk.

The data is serialized in a portable way which allows zero-overhead random access to it by using memory mapped storage: the operating system facilities are used for loading, caching and paging of the data, and most important, accessing it as if it were in memory.

## Why `flatdata`

Flatdata helps creating efficient _read-only_ datasets:

* Zero overhead random access
* Support for bit and byte packing
* Structuring data using a schema definition
* Optimized for large read-only datasets
* Portable, with support for multiple languages

Flatdata _doesn't_ provide:

* Backwards compatible schema evolution
* Support for mutable datasets
* Portable floating point serialization

For more details read [why flatdata](docs/why-flatdata.md).

## Using `flatdata`

### Creating a schema

Define a flatdata archive:
```cpp
namespace loc {
    struct Point {
        x : u32 : 32;
        y : u32 : 32;
    }
    archive Locations {
        pois : vector< Point >;
    }
}
```

The full schema documentation can be found [here](docs/schema-language.md).

### Generating a module

Flatdata relies on a generator that takes a flatdata schema file as an input and
generates a module for one of the supported languages.

The following languages are supported:

  * First-class citizen implementations:
    * **[C++](./flatdata-cpp)** - used extensively, tested excessively normally receives features first
    * **[Rust](./flatdata-rs)** - the newest addition to the family
  * Read-only implementations:
    * **[Python](./flatdata-py)** - used mostly for inspecting the data
    * **[Dot](./flatdata-dot)** - used to generate diagrams of the schema
    * **[Go](./flatdata-go)** - beta implementation


### Generate code

See the [generator's README](./flatdata-py/generator/README.md#usage) for instructions.
