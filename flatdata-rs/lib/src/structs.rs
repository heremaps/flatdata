//! This module contains traits that are implemented by the generated code for
//! structs and archive resources.
//!
//! flatdata's code generator translates a flatdata schema to Rust code. The
//! generated code contains all schema definitions embedded as strings, and for
//! each schema element it implements all needed methods and traits.
//!
//! ## Structs
//!
//! For a flatdata struct, let's say `SomeData`, there are three generated
//! types in Rust: `SomeData`, SomeDataRef` and SomeDataRefMut`. The former
//! type is used to to create the latter two. `SomeDataRef` is used to read
//! data from a serialized archive, `SomeDataRefMut` to write data to archive.
//!
//! ## Indexes and variadic types
//!
//! A `MultiVector` is a heterogeneous container which consists of indexed
//! items, each containing several elements of different types (cf.
//! [`MultiVector`]). For each multivector resource in a flatdata archive
//! the generator creates a type with the same name and a type with suffix
//! `Ref`. The former is used as template parameter of containers
//! `MultiVector` and `MultiArrayView`. They implement the traits `VariadicRef`
//! resp. `VariadicStruct`. Additionally, the multivector is indexed by
//! a struct which is automatically generated flatdata struct. It implements
//! the trait `Index` and `IndexRef`.
//!
//! [`MultiVector`]: struct.MultiVector.html
